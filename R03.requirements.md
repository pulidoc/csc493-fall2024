# CSC 493: R03: Update Requirements and Software Development<sup>1</sup>

## Overview
You created a file called <code>requirements.md</code> where you will have your Preliminary Software Requirements Specification (SRS) and hopefully included a lot of information to help you move forward with initial implemtation. Well, now is the time!

## Documentation

You have two written tasks to complete before next time. First, update the <code>README.md</code> file with any changes you have made in your project. and include links to your concept and requirements files. To add the links, encapsulate the text to be seen with square brackets and then immediately follow that with parenthesis with RELATIVE links that consists of just the filename.

<code>README.md</code>

File Type ID
Project Concept
The concept of File Type ID focuses on reliably identifying a file's type based on its attributes or signatures. By automating file type detection, it enhances cybersecurity, streamlines file management, and reduces the manual workload involved in classifying files. 
Vision
The vision for File Type ID is to create a user-friendly tool that enables efficient file classification, aiding both technical and non-technical users. By prioritizing an intuitive interface and flexible configuration options, this project aims to bridge gaps in usability while improving performance in comparison to traditional file identification tools.
Scope
The project scope covers building an extensive file signature database, enabling customizable file signature definitions, and designing a user interface optimized for usability. This scope ensures that File Type ID will be accessible, efficient, and flexible enough for both individual and professional uses.
Prerequisites
Basic understanding of file structures, pattern recognition, and cybersecurity principles.
Requirements
Magic Number Recognition
The tool should analyze a file's magic number to determine its type. This approach will allow for precise identification, as magic numbers are typically unique to each file format.
Magic Number Database
A database of common magic numbers should be established, covering a wide range of file types (e.g., .pdf, .jpg, .zip).
Built With
Python for backend and file analysis functionalities

Secondly, you are to finalize the Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) in <code>requirements.md</code>. This step includes breaking down still complex components into individual doable pieces and then prioritizing the list to put the most important core components at the top. 

<code>requirements.md</code>

  - **Number**: (List unique requirement number.)
  - **Statement**: (Precisely state the requirement.)
  - **Evaluation Method**: (How can you tell if the completed software satisfies this requirement?)
  - **Dependency**: (List each other requirement on which satisfaction of this requirement depends or write "None")
  - **Priority**: (Assign a priority to this requirement: essential, high, middle, low, or if time permits.)
  - **Requirement revision history**: (when, what, and why)


You may want to use [MarkDown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet) and [MarkDown Live Demo](http://www.markdown-here.com/livedemo.html).

## Begin Software development

Once you determine the CORE requirements of your system, you can start seriously thinking about HOW you want to implement them. There is no length requirement for how much software you write before next time.

# To Submit

Commit changes to your repository and be ready to bring them up in the reporting out session. 

Remember to begin implementing the core components of your system for a "proof of concept" prototype!
